# VS Code Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This repository is a Python based backend of the Autonomous Mobility Management System (AMMS) for the SNAAP. SNAAP is a new type of personal transportation that consists of a network of Ribbonways and individual SNAAP Pods connecting people, places, and things.
The backend is structured to support a modular, layered architecture that promotes separation of concerns and maintainability using DDD principles, CQRS, UoW patterns and async flows where appropriate. Backend primarily based on FastAPI for API routing and Pydantic for data validation, with SQLAlchemy and Alembic for database interactions and migrations.

### Root Folders and Files:
- `api/`: API transport layer (routers, dependencies, contracts/schemas). DDD interface adapter (Presentation layer).
- `chat/`: chat UI and related client-side logic (not in scope for backend-focused tasks). DDD interface adapter (Presentation layer).
- `cli/`: command-line interface for administrative tasks (not in scope for API-focused tasks). DDD interface adapter (Presentation layer).
- `src/core`: core business/domain logic and services. DDD domain layer.
- `src/handlers`: DDD application layer with command/query handlers orchestrating domain and persistence interactions.
- `src/adapters`: DDD infrastructure layer with database, security, and other external integrations. DDD infrastructure layer.
- `main.py`: app entrypoint and router wiring
- `settings.py` / `constants.py`: runtime settings and constants
- `requirements.txt`: dependency list
- `pyproject.toml`: pytest discovery configuration
- `alembic.ini`: Alembic runtime configuration

### Core Architecture (Current Working Pattern)
- Canonical path for new backend work:
  - Chat/CLI features: `chat/*` or `cli/*`
  - REST API features: `api/*` for transport and wiring
	- Router: `api/routers/*`
	- Dependency wiring: `api/dependencies/*`
  - Request/response models: `api/contracts/*`
	- Commands/queries and mapping: `src/handlers/*`
	- Domain entities/services: `src/core/*`
	- Persistence and UoW: `src/adapters/db/*`
  - Other infrastructure or external integrations: `src/adapters/*`
- Active runtime routing is controlled from `main.py`.
- Treat adjacent legacy files as editable only when directly required for the requested task.

### Architecture Rules
- Prefer extending existing Asynchronous Programming (Async I/O), DDD and CQRS approaches over introducing a third pattern.
- Keep routers thin; route handlers should orchestrate, not hold business logic.
- Keep domain and persistence concerns separated.
- Preserve current module boundaries unless a refactor is explicitly requested.

## Finding Related Code

Use this sequence before editing:

1. Start at app wiring in `main.py` to confirm the endpoint/module is active.
2. Open matching router in `api/routers/`.
3. Trace injected dependencies from `api/dependencies/`.
4. Follow into `src/handlers/commands` or `src/handlers/queries`.
5. Follow into domain (`src/core/`) and adapters (`src/adapters/`) as needed.
6. Check request/response models in `api/contracts/`.
7. Review impacted tests in `tests/`.

Search strategy:
- Semantic search first for concept-level discovery.
- Grep search for exact endpoint paths, error messages, symbol names.
- Follow imports and constructor dependencies to identify real execution paths.

## Validating Changes (Mandatory Order)

MANDATORY: Validate in this order and do not declare completion without reporting what was run.

1. Verify touched files compile/import logically (no unresolved symbols introduced).
2. Run targeted tests for the changed behavior.
3. Run broader `pytest` only when needed for confidence.

Validation rules:
- Use `pytest` according to `pyproject.toml` (`tests` discovery).
- Do not run broad test suites first when a focused test is available.
- If validation cannot be run, explicitly state why and what remains unverified.
- Do not fix unrelated failing tests unless the user asks.

## Runtime and Dev Commands

Use existing repository workflows:
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
- Create migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message"`
- Run app locally: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
- Run tests: `pytest`

## Coding Guidelines

### Scope and Diff Discipline
- Implement only what was requested.
- Keep diffs minimal and localized.
- Do not perform opportunistic cleanup in unrelated files.
- Do not move files or rename modules unless requested.

### Python Style and Naming
- Follow existing project style in touched files.
- Use descriptive names; avoid one-letter names except short loop indices.
- Prefer explicit types where the surrounding codebase already uses typing.
- Keep function and method names action-oriented.

### Async and Layering
- Prefer async flows for API, service, and repository interactions where patterns already exist.
- Do not add blocking I/O in async request paths.
- Keep business rules out of routers.
- Use handlers/services/UoW abstractions by introducing new ones when necessary for new functionality.

### Imports and Dependencies
- Never duplicate imports.
- Reuse existing dependencies and utilities when possible.
- Treat import-path inconsistencies as verify-first; do not run global import rewrites by default.

### Error Handling
- Raise/propagate domain/app errors in lower layers.
- Translate to HTTP errors at router/API boundary where appropriate.
- Preserve existing error contract behavior unless change is explicitly requested.

## API, Contracts, and Schema Rules

- If endpoint behavior changes, update related request/response contracts in the same task.
- Keep backward compatibility unless a breaking change is explicitly requested.
- Avoid broad contract/schema consolidation unless requested.

## Database and Migration Rules

- Create/modify migrations only when schema changes.
- Keep migration changes isolated to the requested scope.
- Do not alter unrelated migration history.
- `alembic.ini` path mismatches must be treated as verify-first; do not refactor migration paths automatically.

## Testing Rules

- Follow existing test patterns under `tests/`.
- Add or adjust tests only for directly impacted behavior.
- Prefer targeted, readable assertions aligned with current suite style.
- Do not introduce new test frameworks or structure overhauls unless requested.

## Out of Scope by Default

Unless explicitly requested:
- No architecture migration initiatives.
- No repository-wide naming cleanup.
- No topic-instruction/schema redesign efforts.
- No dependency/tooling overhauls.
- No revival or reliance on deleted legacy design docs.

## Copilot Delivery Checklist

Before finalizing any task:
- [ ] Request scope is fully implemented.
- [ ] Diff is minimal and avoids unrelated edits.
- [ ] Active execution path was validated by tracing from `main.py`.
- [ ] Targeted tests were run, or unvalidated scope was explicitly reported.
- [ ] Migration impact was handled (or explicitly stated as none).
- [ ] API/contract impact was handled (or explicitly stated as none).
- [ ] Risks, assumptions, and follow-up items were listed briefly.
